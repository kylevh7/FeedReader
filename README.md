Instructions:

Please download or clone all of the files in the github repository I have shared with you.

You will need Jasmine installed on your machine either through node.js and npm or any other method you prefer in order to see the testing results I have written. You can find instructions at the website below.

https://jasmine.github.io/

Once installed you may view the webpage, along with the Jasmine test results by opening index.html inside any of your favorite modern browsers. Please scroll to the bottom of the webpage to see the testing results.

The code for the jasmine tests can be found in the feedreader.js for your review.

Thank you,
